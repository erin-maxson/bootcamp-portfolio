        <section class="About-Content">
            <p>After graduating with my Bachelors degree in 2017, much of what I needed to know for my career was learned from what I call "YouTube Academy." As a self-taught digital marketer and website developer, I decided I wanted to go back and get formal education around coding and development. Moving up in both marketing and technology departments at work, I realized how important it was to be able to speak the same language and have true knowledge of how coding works. My team builds out platforms, contributes to major app developments, and supports an ecosystem of over 3,000 members...so it was about time for me to learn how to support my team, too! In this portfolio, you'll find my current (and future!) projects related to coding and development. I hope to add many more soon!</p>
